Abstract

   This document specifies a general Challenge-Response Authentication
   Method (CRAM) for use with SOCKS Version 5 [RFC 1928].  It is
   intended to support various challenge-response mechanisms, such as
   S/KEY and OTP [RFC 1938] as well as authentication tokens.

Introduction

   The protocol specification for SOCKS Version 5 [RFC 1928] specifies a
   generalized framework for the use of arbitrary authentication
   protocols in the initial SOCKS connection setup.  This document
   suggests a general framework for a Challenge-Response Authentication
   Method (CRAM) as it fits into the SOCKS Version 5 authentication
   "subnegotiation."

Initial Negotiation

   During initial SOCKS V5 negotiation, the client and server negotiate
   the authenticiation method.  The METHOD for this protocol shall be
   X'05'.

Challenge-Reponse Framework

   Subnegotiation begins after the client has selected the CRAM
   authentication method.

 Message Format

   In general, messages exchanged consist of a version identifier and a
   list of attribute-value assertions, where attributes are single
   octets and values are sequences of 0-255 octets.

           +-----+-------+------+---------+------+------+---
           | VER | NAVAS | ATT1 | VAL1LEN | VAL1 | ATT2 | ...
           +-----+-------+------+---------+------+------+---
           |  1  |   1   |   1  |    1    | 0-255|  1   | ...
           +-----+-------+------+---------+------+------+---

   VER contains the current version of the subnegotiation, which is
   X'01'.  NAVAS contains the number of attribute-value assertions to
   follow.  Each AVA includes ATT_i, containing the attribute, VAL_iLEN,
   containing the length of VAL_i, and VAL_i.  In general, robust
   implementations should ignore assertions with attributes they do not
   understand.  This provides a powerful and general mechanism for future
   extensions while allowing backward compatibility.

   Notationally, a single message with a list of n assertions shall be
   represented as:

        ATT_1(VAL_1), ATT_2(VAL_2), ... ATT_n(VAL_n)

 Attributes

   The following attribute definitions apply to all messages:

        ATT     Label           Meaning
        ----------------------------------------------
        X'00'   STATUS          0 = success
        X'01'   TEXT-MESSAGE    Informational text
        X'02'   USER-IDENTITY
        X'03'   CHALLENGE
        X'04'   RESPONSE
        X'05'   CHARSET

   The TEXT-MESSAGE attribute may always be included in any message
   (except submethod negotiation.)  Implementations should display its
   contents to the user if applicable; it should be used for advisory
   information (e.g. warnings of pending password expiration,
   explanations accompanying a failure.) If there is no user,
   implementations may log its contents.

   The CHARSET attribute provides advisory infomration about the
   character set in use; it, too, may be present in any message.
   Implementations should use it to guide presentation of information to
   users.  The semantics are identical to that of the charset parameter
   in MIME [RFC 1521]; if absent, a default of ISO-8859-1 should be
   assumed.

   Submethods may also define their own additional attributes, but must
   not redefine the above standard ones.

Protocol Exchange

   Generic challenge-response simply authenticates the client's identity
   by sending a textual challenge from the server which the client
   displays to the user.  The user somehow (e.g. by using an external
   application or a security token) computes the appropriate response and
   enters it.

   First, the client asserts its identity to the server:

        USER-IDENTITY(<username>)

   The server then responds with a textual challenge to be displayed to
   the user:

        CHALLENGE(<challenge>)

   The client displays this challenge, prompts for a response, and sends
   it:

        RESPONSE(<response>)

   The server may respond with a new challenge method, for which a new 
response is
   required.  Arbitrarily many challenges may be issued.
   When the server finished issuing challenges, it sends a status message:

        STATUS(success|failure)

   and the subnegotiation terminates.  If the authentication did not succeed,
   the server must drop the connection.

Security Considerations

   Challenge-response protocols are generally designed to provide
   protection from passive attacks such as sniffing passwords.  The
   security mechanisms here generally offer only limited protection from
   real-time active attacks.

   In most challenge-response security mechanisms, it is important that
   challenges be produced in a fashion an adversary cannot predict or
   duplicate.  As with all negotiation-based security, implementations
   may be vulnerable to downgrade attacks.  Clients and servers should
   refuse to operate with methods and algorithms considered
   insufficiently secure.
